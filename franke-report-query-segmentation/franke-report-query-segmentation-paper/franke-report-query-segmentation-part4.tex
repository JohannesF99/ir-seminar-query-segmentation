\section{Evaluation} \label{evaluation}

The paper by \citeauthor{Risvik:2003} works as a good starting point for the topic query segmentation. It covers the basic concepts to understand most segmentation concepts. Additionally, the authors introduce an easy to understand approach with their connexity score computation. The paper doesn't include any results or evaluation metrics itself, which could be helpfull for potential readers. \citeauthor{Risvik:2003} only mention the corpus they used for their experiments in the conclusion of the original paper, which could be included earlier. They also focus heavily on the efficiency of their experiment setup, where most paper lay the focus on the effectiveness of an approach. In general, the approach works well with most common words and segments but probably falls off for new or rare but important words that most of the time have no high frequency or mutual information.

The second approach by \citeauthor{Bergsma:2007} reiterates and expands on some of the concepts covered by \citeauthor{Risvik:2003}. This is then used to introduce the reader to their approach. There is no short introduction to supervised machine learning or SVMs in general, but they always reference the original paper, so the reader can research the missing concepts on their own. They include examples for most of their features, which makes it easy to understand. As seen in Table \ref{table-segmentation-performance-bergsma-2007}, their approach significantly improves current state-of-the-art baselines like \citeauthor{Risvik:2003}'s approach. Interestingly, the dependecy features don't improve the effectiveness that much and in some cases even decrease it.

\citeauthor{Bergsma:2007}'s paper also provides further information for the connexity score approach. They describe how the computation for mutual information works and present some results in Table \ref{table-segmentation-performance-bergsma-2007}, which the original paper lacks. So the chosen paper build upon each other and provide an overview over the the topic query segmentation in general as well as some possible approaches.
