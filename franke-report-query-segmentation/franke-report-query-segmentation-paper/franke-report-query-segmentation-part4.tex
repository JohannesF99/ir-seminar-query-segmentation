\section{Evaluation} \label{evaluation}

Some evaluation section if appropriate. Usually, you might want to reference some table with some results. For instance, Table~\ref{table-connexity-score-risvik-2003} shows that Entry~A yields the largest number.

\paragraph{Discussion} A good evaluation section includes some discussion of the (dis-)advantages of the different approaches. It is a good idea to also include some examples of inputs on which the different approaches work well / do not work well.
