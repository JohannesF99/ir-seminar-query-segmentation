\begin{abstract}
This report explores query segmentation techniques aimed at enhancing query understanding and information retrieval effectiveness. It focuses on two distinct approaches: the connexity score method by \citet{Risvik:2003} and the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based segmentation approach by \citet{Bergsma:2007}. The former utilizes mutual information and query log mining to identify meaningful n-grams, while the latter frames query segmentation as a supervised classification problem. By analyzing these methods, the study highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach, providing a comprehensive overview of their applicability to modern information retrieval pipelines.
