\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
Today, many state-of-the-art components that are part of Information Retrieval pipelines have been using techniques like Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve effectiveness. But even without the use of these trained models, there exist well-known and proven methods to process relevant data for almost all of the different retrieval aspects. This paper sets the focus on query segmentation as one tool to address and improve query understanding and analysis using proven score computation approaches as well as newer model-based segmentation. 

In order to give a well-rounded summary of this topic, two prominent approaches for improving query segmentation have been chosen. The first approach by \citet{Risvik:2003} was published in 2003 and introduces a measurement for their definition of good segments called \textit{connexity}, while the second approach was published in 2007 by \citet{Bergsma:2007} and treats segmentation as a classification task using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
