\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

Introduction to your report. Maybe you want to reference some publication~\cite{Bergsma:2007}, just give the authors of some publication: \citeauthor{Bergsma:2007}, or give the authors and the reference \citet{Bergsma:2007}. Including graphics also is usually dead simple, like with Figure~\ref{rubber-duck}.
