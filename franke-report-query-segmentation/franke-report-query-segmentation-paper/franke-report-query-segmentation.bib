%%% Fetch your bib entries from dblp! [ https://dblp.org/ ]
%%%
%%% The last three fields of dblp bib entries can safely be removed (timestamp, biburl, and bibsource).
%%%
%%% Use <last-name-first-author>:<year> as the bib keys. In case of different papers that would have the same bib key, append 'a', 'b', etc. in the way how the bibtex process would order the papers. Usually, this is done lexicographically by the first letters of the authors' last names. In case that also these are all the same, then lexicographically by paper title.
%%% Example: A. Author, B. Author: An Introduction to Bib Key Assignment. 2022.
%%%          A. Author, B. Author: Second Thoughts on Bib Key Assignment. 2022.
%%% 
%%%          The first paper would get the bibkey author:2022a and the second would get author:2022b.
%%%
%%% In case that some references is not present on dblp, mimic the look and feel of bib entries from dblp!
