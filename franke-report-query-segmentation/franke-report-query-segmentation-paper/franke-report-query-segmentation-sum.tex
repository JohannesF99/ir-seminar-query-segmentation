\paragraph*{approach 1}
%In conclusion, this approach to query segmentation demonstrates a promising increase in search quality by leveraging connexity measures derived from mined query logs. Although the query log corpus was not explicitly named earlier, it is clarified later in the paper. The authors claim that their approach yields a "significant increase in search quality," though no formal evaluation metrics or test results are provided. Looking , further improvements in feature engineering could make connexity even more effective. Refining the segmentation process and enhancing the ability of retrieval system to parse and interpret complex queries could also improve the approach.
