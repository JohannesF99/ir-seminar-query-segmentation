\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

Query segmentation remains a critical aspect of query understanding and information retrieval. The connexity score approach introduced by \citet{Risvik:2003} demonstrates efficiency in handling multiword queries by leveraging query logs and mutual information. However, its reliance on frequency-based metrics limits its effectiveness with rare or novel terms. On the other hand, the SVM-based segmentation approach by \citet{Bergsma:2007} adopts a more sophisticated supervised learning paradigm, yielding significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. By integrating features like mutual information, part-of-speech tags, and contextual dependencies, this method achieves state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the manual annotation of training data and dependency on high-quality query logs persist. Future research should focus on combining the interpretability of traditional methods with the adaptability of machine learning models to create more robust and scalable solutions.
