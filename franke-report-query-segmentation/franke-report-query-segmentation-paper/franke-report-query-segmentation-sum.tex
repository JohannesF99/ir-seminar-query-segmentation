\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

Query segmentation remains a critical aspect of query understanding and information retrieval. The connexity score approach introduced by \citet{Risvik:2003} improves the handling of multiword query segmentation by using query logs and mutual information. However, it relies on frequency-based metrics that limit the effectiveness with new or rare terms. On the other hand, the SVM-based segmentation approach by \citet{Bergsma:2007} uses a more complex supervised learning model, showing improvements in segmentation accuracy. By integrating features like mutual information, part-of-speech tags, and context dependencies, this method achieves state-of-the-art results. Despite the improvements made in query segmentation, challenges such the dependency on high-quality query logs still exist. Future research could focus on combining traditional methods with the approaches that use machine learning models to improve query segmentation even further.
